# Data Structure & Algorithm with Java

This repository focuses on popular data structures
and algorithms, specifically tailored for solving
LeetCode and technical interview problems using
Java.

Each algorithm pattern is organized into its own
folder, which includes the related test files and
a README.md file to provide explanations.

## Data Structure

**A data structure**  is a collection of data
organized
in some fashion. The structure not only
`stores` data but also supports operations for `
accessing` and `manipulating` the data.
In object-oriented thinking, a data structure,
also known as a *container* or *container object*,
is an object that stores other objects, referred
to as data or elements. To define a data structure
is essentially to define a class.

### Collections

The Collection interface defines the common
operations for lists, vectors, stacks,
queues, priority queues, and sets.

The Java Collections Framework supports `two types
of containers`:

1. One for storing a collection of elements is
   simply called a collection.
2. The other, for storing key/value pairs, is
   called a map.

### Iterators

Each collection is `Iterable`. You can obtain its
Iterator object to traverse all the
elements in the collection.
Iterator is a classic design pattern for walking
through a data structure without having to
expose the details of how data is stored in the
data structure.
