## Description:

The Sliding Window pattern in programming is used
to solve problems involving a subset of data in a
linear data
structure. The "Maximum Average Subarray I"
problem specifically focuses on finding the
subarray with the maximum
average value. This can be efficiently achieved
using the Sliding Window technique, which involves
maintaining a window
of a fixed size and sliding it across the array to
compute the sum and average of the elements within
the window, thus
optimizing the process compared to a brute-force
approach.

`Sliding Window` have 2 types;

* Fixed window Size( The code in this package
  using Fixed window Size approaches);
* Dynamic Window Size;
