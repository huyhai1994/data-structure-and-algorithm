# Recursive Palindrome Problem's solution

This code snippet demonstrates a recursive function to check if a given string is a palindrome. The
`isPalindrome` function takes a string `str`, along with two indices `start` and `end`, which
represent
the
current range of characters being checked.

The function checks if the characters at the `start` and `end` indices are equal. If they are not,
the
function returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the start index is
greater than or equal to the end index, the function returns true, indicating that the string is a
palindrome.

In the `main` method, the `isPalindrome` function is called with the string "moon" and the initial
indices 0 and the length of the string minus one. The result is then printed to the console.

To document this code, you can add comments to explain the purpose of the function and its
parameters, as well as the logic of the recursive calls.
